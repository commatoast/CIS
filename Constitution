=== Preamble ===

In the intent of promoting the stability and viability of independent worlds in the Galaxy,  encouraging trade, and sharing culture, the worlds of the CIS agree with each other on the following clauses, creating the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

When applicable, the points bellow are reciprocal when citizens and ships visit another world in the Confederacy.

=== (1) Citizen Rights ===

* (1a) Citizens of member worlds of the Confederacy are allowed to land on any open and public landing zone with minimal formalities and fees. Their trade is allowed in the vicinity of this landpad. 

 * (1b) Citizens may be checked for weapons, and asked to remove weapons, but those weapons must be returned upon a citizen leaving. If they are asked to remove weapons, then a local security force must be present to protect them, otherwise they should be permitted to carry a weapon for defensive purposes.

* (1c) Citizens who are detained for any reason must be told why they are being detained, and must be allowed to use sub-space communication relays to contact their home world and notify them of their detainment.

* (1d) Citizens who visit member worlds have to comply with the local laws of the system they are in. 

* (1e) If a Citizen is being interrogated or put to trial in a member system, then the court must allow them to be represented by an attorney of the Citizen's choice. 

* (1f) Torture may not be used against Citizens of member worlds.

* (1g) Warrants: Citizens may resist an official CIS security team attempting to confiscate an item or arrest a person, if the forces cannot show a proper Warrant.
- (1g-I) Warrants may only be issued by the CIS Assembly (CIS-wide warrants) or the recognized ruling authority of a member world (local warrants). 
- (1g-II) Local warrants may be voided on other systems if that system's recognized ruling authority issues a special mandate granting asylum within their territory to the target of the warrant. In such a case, CIS forces may not enforce the warrant while its target is within the territory of the member granting asylum.
- (1g-III) The Assembly may only warrant confiscation when particular items or vessels in question jeopardize the rights of citizens or the security of member worlds or shipping lanes, or if the trade is a form of a scam or fraud. Things such as counterfeit credits, fake goods, supplies for known enemies, etc. are the type of things this might affect. 

=== (2) Confederate Capital & Assembly ===

* (2a) Each month the Capital of the CIS shall rotate alphabetically to the next member world, unless they pass. The Capital shall be where the Assemblies are held, and it shall provide a President to preside over each Assembly. 

* (2b) The CIS President who presides over the meetings has equal power to all other Envoys from member worlds. The President shall not have any additional powers beyond regular Envoys. The only difference between President, and a regular Envoy, is the President cannot vote on an issue unless it is a tie-breaker vote. The President can call emergency meetings.

* (2c) The Confederate Assembly consists of Envoys and their aides from each world who are appointed by their origin government. They cannot be sued by individual worlds of the Confederacy for the acts committed during their mandate. Each government must vouch for the Envoy it sends with an authorized official communication. The Envoy may bring up to four aides along with them to the Assembly but only the Envoy may speak without special permission.

* (2d) A Confederate system may request immunity for a diplomat they sent to another one. When granted, it can be revoked later.

* (2e) The Confederate Assembly shall have the following powers:
    - (2e-I) to ensure the security of shipping lanes, ports, remote colonies, and trade stations within the limits of this treaty
    - (2e-II) to agree upon the currency to be used by member worlds
    - (2e-III) to provide the hard currency and standards if CIS Assembly chooses 
    - (2e-IV) to regulate commerce between member worlds ensuring fair and safe trade
    - (2e-V) to enforce such trade regulations along the trade routes and official ports
    - (2e-VI) to maintain hyperspace lanes and subspace communications relays
    - (2e-VII) to catch and punish pirates that victimize protected shipping lanes,
    - (2e-VIII) to quell any attempt at insurrection against itself
    - (2e-IX) to appoint a diplomatic representative of the CIS to represent it to other similar groups of worlds
    
=== (3) Trade Regulations ===

* (3a) CIS or member world security forces may enforce CIS trade regulations within the designated port areas. This does not apply to areas of any planet that are outside the authorized trading port areas. Member world governments are solely responsible for private trade and the CIS has no jurisdiction there unless a mandate is issued to specifically allow for it (see section 4h).

* (3b) Goods, vessels, or documents may not be confiscated, and persons may not be arrested, by CIS security on the grounds of trade violations without a warrant from the Assembly.

* (3c) Any trade-related goods or documents, or other items, confiscated by security forces must be held in CIS vaults on the Capital world for further investigation and review by the Assembly. If they are cleared then they must be released.

* (3d) Any prisoners taken for violating trade regulations must be held in the current Capital world. Any confiscated vessels must be harbored there.

* (3e) Confederated worlds are free to tie trade relationships with outside worlds provided they announce to the Assembly for review whenever a trading clause is more favourable for an ally than for CIS member worlds.

=== (4) Military Acts ===
This section defines the duties and limits of any official CIS military forces, which are those forces that the CIS Assembly has put into place through any official Acts.

* (4a) Any official Security forces may only act within designated CIS Trade Security Zones unless an additional mandate is provided (see sections 4h & 6b). Such forces have a de facto mandate from all member worlds to do the following within TSZs:
- (4a-I) defend TSZs from hostile forces
- (4a-II) ensure the security of TSZs
- (4a-III) enforce CIS trade regulations upon member worlds within TSZs. 

* (4b) Any security forces may be provided by members or contracted by members as long as those forces do not separately act to threaten the CIS in any way. The Assembly may vote to ban certain forces from acting in its defense if they violate this. 

* (4c) The Assembly may contract private security forces and/or establish its own security force.

* (4d) Confederated systems agree to abstain from using the war as a means to solve the conflicts with fellow members. Eventual conflicts between members shall be brought to the Council.

* (4e) When a planet is in peace, servicemen and military equipment from a world of the Confederacy in war may be harboured for a duration which cannot exceed three days until they will be totally disarmed if they decided to stay. They'll not be allowed to commit any act of war during their stay.

* (4f) All CIS military acts must be defensive in nature only. No official military forces of the CIS may take offensive military action against any world or system.
- (4f-I) Definition of "offensive military action": this shall be taken to mean any violent action carried out by official CIS forces that would not directly prevent harm to a CIS world, or which would involve CIS forces performing a military action outside of any territories controlled by CIS worlds or outside of their de facto and special mandates.

 * (4g) If a member world takes an offensive military act, then it must be made clear NOT to be an act of the CIS. Such actions are the sole responsibility of those individual worlds who may have committed the act. The CIS as a whole shall not be held to blame for the acts of certain of its Independent Systems. (Also see section 5c.)

* (4h) Special mandates: Confederate troops or contracted forces must request a special mandate delivered by the local authorities of any member system before they may intervene outside any designated CIS Trade Security Zone(s) within the member world's territory (see section 6). 
- (4h-I) A special mandate details the location, the duration, the mission, and who has the commandment of the detachment. 
- (4h-II) The duties described in section (4a) are implied as a "de facto" mandate for any official CIS forces to perform, and therefore they do not require a special mandate for those duties
- (4h-III) A special mandate may be issued that nullifies the "de facto" mandate for a given member world.
- (4h-IV) Only the recognized ruling authority of a member world may issue special mandates for that world to CIS forces.

=== (5) Membership ===

* (5a) New worlds groups of worlds (if all under the same governmental jurisdiction, see section 5f) may be approved for governing membership in the CIS by the unanimous vote of the Assembly. Thereby a government of a world or group of worlds becomes a new single voting member of the CIS Assembly.
- (5a-I) Membership may only be held by a governing entity. To qualify as "governing," an entity must hold sovereign, ruling, military authority over a distinct geographic region that is open to general galactic travel and trade. Any other entities who do not qualify as "governing" shall be considered "non-governing" and may apply for CIS Affiliation (see sectino 7).

* (5b) Members are free to quit the treaty any time, announcing it to the Assembly. 

* (5c) The Assembly may vote to pronounce the suspension or the exclusion of a member world from the treaty for any necessary reason, especially if it jeopardizes the general security of CIS worlds, or if it violates this treaty.

* (5d) This treaty may be extended with Acts, modified, and/or ammended in the future with unanimous agreement of the Assembly.

* (5e) Member worlds may not maintain other public, major, official Confederations, Alliances, or Treaties, issue their own currency, without express approval of the CIS Assembly. Entering and remaining in the CIS must constitute an action of a member's sovereign government, and not a sub-section thereof. (However, private, informal, unofficial, diplomatic agreements between member and non-member worlds are not directly subject to this regulation, but they must be presented to the Assembly for review to ensure they do not conflict with existing CIS relations.) 

* (5f) Groups of worlds that are ruled under one government (e.g. traditional governments such as a dominion, an empire, a kingdom, a federation, a ruled space; or business governments such as a collective, a consortium, a co-op, a corporation, etc.) may enter the CIS as a single entity with the following provisions:
- (5f-I) Upon joining, a group of worlds may only enter one planet or distinct planetary region into the rotation of CIS capital worlds and shall retain the same alphabetical position in rotation even if they change the planet that is entered, unless the Assembly votes otherwise. 
- (5f-II) Groups of worlds who join as a single entity only get a single voting member of the Assembly. For example if a kingdom of 10 worlds joins the CIS, they do not get 10 voting members on the Assembly, only one. 
- (5f-III) Any world that is officially part of a group of worlds as ruled by a single governing body shall not be permitted to join the CIS as an independent world. 
- (5f-IV) After joining the CIS, if a group of worlds adds additional worlds to its group, it must notify the CIS assembly. At this time, the CIS assembly can choose to vote to remove this group from the CIS, in order to prevent an expansionist regime (for example) from being a CIS member.  
- (5f-V) If a former member of a group of worlds that is re-entering also seeks to re-enter, they must re-enter the CIS simultaneously to prevent one from blocking the re-entry of the other.

* (5g) Planets, distinct planetary regions, or space stations with multiple ruling governments: In the case of planets with multiple ruling governments, only one shall be permitted to hold a seat on the CIS Assembly. This one shall be considered the "recognized representative ruling authority" of that world.
- (5g-I) Any member world that has multiple ruling governments shall provide to the Assembly a list of each and the leader of it, along with a signed waiver from the leader of each stating that they grant the right to be represented in the CIS Assembly to whoever is representing that world.
- (5g-II) Should any other governments of a member world protest the world's membership in the CIS or hold any grievances related to the world's membership in the CIS, they may come before the CIS Assembly and present their case. 
- (5g-III) The CIS Assembly may vote to remove a world from CIS membership if it is deemed to be in a state of internal civil war or civil discord that prevents it from acting as a single independent world with a recognized ruling authority.

=== (6) Territory ===
Territory is defined as meaning that physical space that falls under the jurisdiction and full sovereign authority of a particular member world.

* (6a) Exclusive territory: Exclusive territory means that space in which no CIS forces shall act without a special mandate (see section 4). Other than those areas defined in section 6b, the following areas are, by default, considered to be the "exclusive" territory of each member world's recognized ruling authority:
- (6a-I) Surface areas: the entire planetary surface, area of distinct planetary region, or space station interior and exterior surfaces,  of a member world is considered as exclusive territory.
- (6a-II) Interplanetary space: the entire space of a star system and the area within half the distance to the next-nearest system is considered to be part of that world's exclusive territory. 
- (6a-III) Interstellar space: by default, any space that constitutes an uninterrupted, direct path between two star systems that are both part of a group membership is considered to be that member's exclusive territory. 

* (6b) Official CIS Trade Security Zones (TSZ): by default, every CIS member world shall feature at least one TSZ upon the surface of each publicly accessible planet and space station. Unless defined otherwise via signage, banners, notices, etc., the following are taken by default as TSZs on each world:
- (6b-I) Surface: the primary public spaceport structure on the surface of the planet, planetary region, space station. This includes the landing pad and any directly adjacent building that must be passed through in order to visit the surface.
- (6b-II) Interstellar: the entire extent of public trading hyperlane(s) leading to the planet from other member worlds, and the nearest half of any trading hyperlanes leading into the system from non-CIS worlds (see section 6c).
- (6b-III) Interplanetary: the interplanetary public trading spacelanes (see section 6d). This default TSZ fully encompasses a planet's surrounding orbital space, or that space that lies over the planetary region, or which surrounds the space station.

* (6c) Public trading hyperlanes: these shall be defined as those interstellar hyperspace travel lanes used for trading purposes. Specifically, the areas of the TSZ are any realspace entrance/exit areas of hyperlanes, as well as the realspace connection areas that exist between non-continuous hyperlanes.

* (6d) Public trading spacelanes: these shall be defined as those realspace travel lanes leading from hyperlanes to spaceports. 

=== (7) Affiliated Groups ===

* (7a) The CIS Assembly may vote to grant official CIS Affiliation to a group who potentially shares some interests with the CIS, such as a corporation, conglomerate, guild, mercenary force, religious order, thereby adding them as a CIS Affiliated Group (AG).

* (7b) CIS AGs shall be divided into panels, listed below, according to the primary mode of relation to the CIS. More categories shall be added by vote of the Assembly as the need arises.
- (7b-I) Commerce panel: a privately-held commercial enterprise that operates within the CIS.
- (7b-II) Cultural panel: an entity who represents the interests of a particular cultural or ethnic group within the CIS.
- (7b-III) Security panel: a group whose primary mode of operation is that of providing security services for members of the CIS.
- (7b-IV) Diplomatic panel: serving as a diplomat for an outside government or other outside interest to the CIS.
- (7e-V) Financial panel: provides CIS-wide financial or banking services.
- (7e-VI) Other types of AGs may be added by vote of the CIS Assembly.

* (7c) Each panel may submit referendums that the CIS Assembly must vote on, but only if it concerns matters related to their category. 
- (7c-I) The Assembly is required to either vote directly on a referendum unless a motion is passed by vote that the referendum is deemed to be irrelevant to the direct concerns of the referring panel's category.
- (7c-II) If the assembly's vote is tied on a panel's referendum, it shall be considered as having passed, in the interest of progress.
