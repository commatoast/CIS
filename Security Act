Act for the Establishment of Official CIS Contracted Defense & Security Forces (CDSF)
v. 1.1

=== Preamble ===

The CIS Constitution section (4c) grants the CIS Assembly the ability to "contract private security forces". This Act establishes a standing private security force and outlines the administration of it. In accordance with the CIS Constitution section (4a), the CDSF are tasked with defending CIS member worlds from hostile forces and policing trading lanes and ports in accordance with the conditions of this Act and the limits set forth in the CIS Constitution.

=== (1) Name & Identification ===

(1a) Name: This treaty creates an amalgam of privately contracted forces that shall collectively be referred to as "Contracted Defense & Security Forces" ("CDSF"). 

(1b) Identifying marks: agents and vehicles of contractors are required to clearly display CIS CDSF badges, flags, or emblems approved by the CIS Assembly. This is to identify them to citizens as official CIS CDSF as opposed to local forces, etc. The Assembly may require that any official identification be marked with additional security measures as well to prevent counterfeiting.

(1c) CDSF contractors are forbidden from displaying the CIS logo or official CIS CDSF identifying marks when operating outside their CIS contract and mandate. This is to prevent the CIS from being implicated in the outside actions of contractors, who are free to accept contracts from other bodies besides the CIS. 

(1d) Each individual CDSF Contractor is refered to as a CDSF-C.

=== (2) Purpose ===

(2a) The specific purpose of the CDSF is to defend CIS worlds, protect CIS citizens, enforce CIS trade regulations in designated CIS Trade Security Zones (TSZs), and to remain available for CIS worlds to call via special mandates upon should they need additional defense or security in other parts of their sovereign territory (see CIS Constitution section 4h).

=== (3) Administration ===

(3a) The CIS Assembly shall approve any contracts for CDSF service prior to the contract being offered to a potential contractor. 

(3b) The CIS Assembly shall approve who a contract is being offered to.

(3c) The acting CIS President shall be responsible at the beginning of their term for acquiring from the last President the current folder of all signed contracts and list of active contractors serving that constitutes the active CDSF.

(3d) The acting CIS President shall have the authority to temporarily suspend any CDSF contracts when doing so would be in the best interest of CIS security and defense. A vote of the Assembly can override the President on this.

=== (4) Duties of the CDSF ===

(4a) See section (4a) of CIS Constitution.

=== (5) Command Structure ===

(5a) Each contracted security provider must list three individuals per section (space and ground) who constitute the top chain of command within their organization. Regardless of their rank names within their own group, within the CDSF for the purposes of clarity they will be given the following CDSF utilitarian titles: 
(5a-I) Primary Contact: whoever is first in command of their forces.
(5a-II) Secondary Contact: whoever is second in command of their forces.
(5a-III) Tertiary Contact: whoever is third in command of their forces, or if no one is, then a high-ranking member who can be contacted in case of emergency.

(5b) When operating within a member world's territory, if multiple CDSF-Cs have forces present, the following rules must be honored to determine which CDSF-C has final command authority in that situation:
(5b-I) 

=== (6) Contracts ===

(6a) Each contract shall specifically define the area of intervention, the time they are hired for, their power and the limit of it. 
(6a-I) Each contract must contain a special clause that, if the Contract is found to violate the CIS Constitution or any Acts of the CIS Assembly, it may be terminated.

(6b) Each contract shall be paid out of a collective security fund contributed to evenly by all members of the CIS using CIS credits. The payment may be in any form however, such as hard goods, services, or any other currency specified by a contract. 
(6b-I) Existing contracts between a CDSF-C and an existing member world may alleviate portions of a member's contributions that overlap with services named in a new contract. The Assembly must approve any such alleviations upon request of the member.
